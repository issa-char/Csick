A static library is essentially a collection of object code, compiled from `.c` files, stored within a single archived file.

Static libraries offer an efficient way to encapsulate source files containing functions, variables, and more that are needed in a project. They promote code reusability and modularity in C projects.

To create a static library, you need object files. The C compilation process, consisting of preprocessing, optional assembly, compilation, and linking, can produce object files. In the third phase of this process, the gcc compiler conducts lexical, semantic, and syntax analysis, generating object code files with a .o extension.

Use the GNU "ar" tool to create a static library:

1. Create the library with all necessary object files:
   ```
   $ ar -rc libname.a *.o
   ```

2. Optionally, index the object files for faster symbol lookup:
   ```
   $ ranlib libname.a
   ```

3. Verify the library's contents to ensure object files are included:
   ```
   $ ar -t libname.a
   ```

Now, let's discuss how to utilize a static library in your C projects. After creating a C source file that relies on functionality from one of the object files within your static library, link the library as follows:

```shell
$ gcc main.c -L. -lname -o main
```

This command compiles "main.c" and links it with the specified static library. This allows your C project to access the functionality provided by the object files during compilation.

To run your program, simply execute it:
