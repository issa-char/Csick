When running a program in the terminal and providing optional arguments, you are essentially passing arguments to the main function, particularly in the case of a C executable. This is a fundamental concept in command-line programming.

To enable a C program to accept and process these arguments, we declare the main function with parameters that receive these inputs. Here are the common prototypes of the main function to accept arguments:

1. `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`: This prototype is the most frequently used and accepted standard. It allows the program to accept command-line arguments. `argc` represents the count of arguments passed to the program, while `argv` is an array of null-terminated strings that store the arguments supplied by the user. The first element of `argv` (i.e., `argv[0]`) typically holds the program's name, and the subsequent elements contain the arguments provided.

2. `int main()`: This is the simplest form of the main function and doesn't accept any arguments. It's used when your program doesn't require command-line arguments.

3. `int main(int ac, char *ar[], char *env[])`: This prototype is less common and includes additional arguments such as the environment variables (`env[]`). It is typically used when your program needs access to environment variables along with command-line arguments.

To simplify the understanding of these parameters:
- `argc` and `ac` specify the count of arguments passed to the function.
- `argv` and `ar` are arrays of null-terminated pointers to strings that store the supplied arguments.
- The first element, i.e., `argv[0]` or `ar[0]`, contains the program's name, and subsequent elements contain the provided arguments.

These arguments enable your C program to interact with the user and perform specific tasks based on the input provided via the terminal. They are essential for creating flexible and user-friendly command-line applications.
